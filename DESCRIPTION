Description: Given Poverty Probability Index (PPI) scores based on the standard 
    10 questions on householdâ€™s chdaracteristics and asset ownership, the 
    likelihood that the household is living below the poverty line can be
    determined using this package. This package depends on country-specific
    lookup tables developed for the PPI available via the ppitables package.
