\description{
The Poverty Probability Index (PPI) is a poverty measurement tool
for organizations and businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI
is statistically-sound, yet simple to use: the answers to 10 questions about
a householdâ€™s characteristics and asset ownership are scored and then given
these PPI scores, the likelihood that the household is living below the poverty
line can be determined using this package. This package depends on country-specific
lookup tables developed for the PPI available via the \code{ppitables} package.
